      <p>
        My name is Jaslina K Kochhar, and welcome to my about me page!
        I’m a self-driven, organized and passionate Computer Science student with excellent problem-solving skills,
        strong attention to detail, and extraordinary communication skills.
        If you are looking for my resume, you can find it <a href="JaslinaKochhar_CurrentResume.pdf">here</a>.
        This page contains a lot of the same content as my resume, so both are great ways to learn a bit about me.
        I also have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaslina-kochhar-736858195/">LinkedIn</a>. Also, feel free to checkout at my <a href="https://github.com/jaslinakaur">GitHub profile</a>!
