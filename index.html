      <p>
        My name is Jaslina K Kochhar, and welcome to my about me page!
        I’m a self-driven, organized and passionate Computer Science student with excellent problem-solving skills, strong attention to detail, and extraordinary communication skills.
        If you are looking for my resume, you can find it here.
        This page contains a lot of the same content as my resume, so both are great ways to learn a bit about me.
        I also have a LinkedIn. Also, feel free to checkout at my GitHub profile!
